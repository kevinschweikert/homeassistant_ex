# Homex

This library aims to bring Elixir (and especially Nerves) closer to Home Assistant. This is a work in progress based on the [initial idea](https://elixirforum.com/t/nerves-home-assistant-integration/70920).

## TODO

- [ ] add example folder with self contained application/livebook

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `homex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:homex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/homex>.
